The Plagiarism Detector project is a simple but effective tool designed to analyze two essays and determine their level of similarity. It works by cleaning the text of each essay-converting all words to lowercase, removing punctuation, and filtering out common stop words—before breaking the text into a list of meaningful words. The program then performs multiple tasks: it allows the user to search for how many times a specific word appears in each essay, identifies all common words shared between the two texts, and calculates the plagiarism similarity using the Jaccard similarity formula. Based on the percentage generated, the program informs the user whether the similarity level is high or acceptable. Additionally, the user is given the choice to save a detailed similarity report, which includes the calculated percentage and a list of common words, inside a dedicated reports folder.

To prepare the environment for running the program, the project includes a setup script named setup.sh. When executed, this script automatically creates the necessary folders—essays and reports—and generates a setup log containing timestamps and information about the created directories. This ensures that the project is correctly structured before use. To run the plagiarism detector, the user simply places the two essays, essay1.txt and essay2.txt, inside the essays folder and executes the Python script. The program then guides the user through the entire process with clear prompts and outputs.

Overall, this project provides a straightforward command-line solution for text comparison. It does not require any additional external libraries, making it easy to run in any standard Python environment. The structure is clean and user-friendly, and the tool can be expanded in the future with other similarity metrics, graphical interfaces, or web-based implementations.
